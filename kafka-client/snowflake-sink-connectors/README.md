# Connector configurations

### Note:
- In this section we are not including the *connector-config.json* file as it contains sensitve information regarding our snowflake account. However, we include a *connector-config-template.json* file which contains the information on our *connector-config.json* without the sensitive information - which you would have to include to run the sink connector.

- Thus, to proceed, insert your snowflake credentials and rename the *connector-config-template.json* file to *connector-config.json*.

- [Set up the Snowflake's user public key](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/kafka-connector-install#configuring-the-kafka-connector)
