# Client-side

## What it is:
Our client side will be composed of social media simulators that will create data that we predict is commonly generated by real-life applications -e.g. instagram, facebook, tiktok, etc.

### Sign-Up data client (Python):
The first client will simulate sign-up data. The sign-up data is composed of the following fields:
- user_id (generated, unique)
- mobile number (optional, unique)
- email (required, unique)
- username (required, unique)
- first name (required)
- last name (required)
